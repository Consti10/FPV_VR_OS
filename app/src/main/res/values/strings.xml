    <string name="app_name">FPV-VR for wifibroadcast</string>

    <string name="SuperSyncDescription">Advanced VR rendering technique, modified for FPV-VR. Lowest input lag possible (8.3ms), without any visual imperfections
        like tearing. Has high performance and hardware requirements, that are only fulfilled on high-end phones. I recommend a Daydream-ready device.
        If you enable this technique on non-daydream ready phones, you might see stuttering and/or tearing.
    </string>
    <string name="DisableVSYNCDescription">
        Disables VSYNC (Vertical Sync). Reduces input lag to ~16.6ms@120fps or less, depending on your hardware (higher fps->less latency).
        WARNING: Has the negative side effect of Tearing (Visual imperfections) and wasted frames  It is up to you if you can live with tearing for a lower
        latency, but I definitely recommend enabling this option if available.
    </string>
    <string name="Disable60FPSLockDescription">
        VSYNC on (no tearing), but >60 OpenGL fps (lower latency). Input lag is at ~33.2ms@120fps.
        WARNING: when your phone has trouble rendering at >60fps, enabling this option can increase latency. Also, disabling VSYNC gives much lower latency.
    </string>
    <string name="MSAADescription">
        MSAA increases quality with very little performance loss.
        Which MSAA level to choose depends on your GPU power, screen resolution and magnification of your VR headset.
        Most modern tile-based GPUs can handle up to 4xMSAA with only 10-20perc. performance loss, while increasing quality significantly.
